// Object Oriented Program (OOP)

// Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object.

String.prototype.yell = function () {
  // its a custom prototype that called "yell"
  console.log(this);
};

// Object Oriented Programming

// It means organizing our code, designing and structuring our applications by breaking things up into distinct patterns of objects.
