// What is Node?
// Technically it's a JavaScript runtime.
// Javascript runtime refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8

// So it's the job of a browser to follow the rules and implement the language.

// !! Node is an implementation of JavaScript that runs outside of the browser.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log('HELLO NODE');
}

// Process
// https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process

// The process object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.
